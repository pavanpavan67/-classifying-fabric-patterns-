Pattern Sense is a deep learning project designed to automatically classify fabric patterns from images using convolutional neural networks. It streamlines the process of identifying common pattern types—such as stripes, florals, and geometrics—making it valuable for textile, fashion, and retail industries.

This project leverages powerful image recognition techniques to deliver accurate and fast fabric pattern classification. By training on a diverse dataset of fabric images, Pattern Sense can distinguish between a variety of patterns including plaid, abstract, polka dots, and more. The automated classification reduces manual effort in cataloging textiles and improves searchability in digital inventories.

Key features include:
- *Easy integration:* The system can be adapted for use in web and mobile applications.
- *Customizable classes:* Users can expand or refine pattern categories according to specific needs.
- *Transfer learning:* Built on robust pre-trained models for faster development and improved accuracy.
- *User-friendly interface:* Simple prediction scripts and visualization tools allow for quick deployment and experimentation.

Pattern Sense is ideal for businesses seeking to automate inventory management, assist customers in fabric selection, or analyze trends in pattern usage. The project is open for contributions and can be extended to support more complex pattern detection tasks in the future.
